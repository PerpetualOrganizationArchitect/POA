These Perpetual Organizations, once deployed, are sustained by decentralized technology at all levels ensuring they operate continuously without central points of failure. 

Coupled with voting tokens that can only be earned and not purchased, Perpetual Organizations are entirely controlled by the community.

The AlphaV1 release is packed with innovative features that include a variety of voting mechanisms, a robust AI assistant, customizable roles, and integrated financial tools to support organizational growth and sustainability. 

Poa hopes to create a future where worker ownership is the deafult. 

##### AlphaV1 will launch May 10th.

## AI Integration

Poa utilizes an advanced AI chatbot that guides you through the setup process, helping you select the most suitable features for your organization. This AI:
- **Provides Examples**: Illustrates potential use cases and setups for different types of organizations.
- **Offers Suggestions**: Recommends features and configurations based on the specific needs and goals of your organization.
- **Feature Selection Assistance**: Helps streamline the creation process, making it accessible even for users with no prior technical knowledge.

## Voting Mechanisms and Options

In Poa, governance is flexible yet powerful, with several voting systems available:
- **Direct Democracy**: Every member has an equal vote on proposals.
- **Participation-Based Voting**: Votes are weighted based on members' engagement and contributions to the organization. This empowers workers paying them with voting power and distribution of revenue. 
- **Hybrid Voting**: Combines elements of direct democracy and participation-based voting, allowing weights to be adjusted (e.g., 70% participation, 30% direct). This is used if you want to ensure that the community and the contributors both want the vote to pass. Ideal for deciding projects to work on.
- **Quadratic Voting**: Enables scaling of vote power based on the intensity of members' preferences based on square root function. This helps prevent outsized voices from havign too much of an influence.
- **Custom Quorum**: Organizations can set and modify the quorum percentage needed for different types of decisions.

These mechanisms can be applied to both general governance and specific functions like treasury management, project creation, or DAO upgrades. These voting systems were build purposefully to strengthen community, not investor, ownership.

## Decentralized Task Manager

The decentralized task manager in Poa AlphaV1 automates task assignment and payouts, fostering operational efficiency and transparency. Integrated with on-chain technology, this system ensures that all actions are recorded and verifiable, enhancing both security and trust within the organization.

### Task Compensation Rubric

To ensure fair compensation for contributions, Poa utilizes a detailed compensation formula based on the difficulty and estimated time required to complete a task. Below is the compensation structure:

#### Compensation Formula:
**Total Tokens = Base Tokens + (Difficulty Multiplier Ã— Estimated Hours)**

- **Base Tokens**: The fixed amount of tokens awarded for each task completion.
- **Difficulty Multiplier**: Reflects the complexity and skill required for the task.
- **Estimated Hours**: Time projected to complete the task, rounded to the nearest whole hour.

#### Compensation Table:

| Difficulty Level | Base Tokens | Multiplier (Tokens per Hour) |
|------------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Easy             | 1           | 16.5                         |
| Medium           | 4           | 24                           |
| Hard             | 10          | 30                           |
| Very Hard        | 25          | 37.5                         |

#### Difficulty Levels:
- **Easy**: Tasks that are straightforward and require minimal specific skills or expertise.
- **Medium**: Tasks that require a moderate level of skills and take a bit more time.
- **Hard**: Tasks that are complex and require advanced skills.
- **Very Hard**: Tasks that are exceptionally challenging and require specialized expertise.

##### Example:
Completing a "Medium" task estimated at two hours would calculate the total tokens as follows:
**Total Tokens = 4 + (24 x 2)**

This system is designed to incentivize participation and reward members fairly based on the effort and skill required for each task, encouraging a more engaged and productive community. In the future different models will be able to be selected and an appeals process will be put in place if a task was deserving of more tokens than initially set. 

## Custom Roles

Organizational roles in Poa can be extensively customized to fit the unique governance and operational needs of your DAO:
- **Task Management**: Assign different permissions for reviewing, creating, and managing tasks, allowing for flexible and efficient workflow management.
- **Voting and Proposals**: Enable specific roles to initiate or vote on proposals, ensuring that decision-making processes are both inclusive and controlled.

These features provide a robust framework for creating and managing dynamic, decentralized organizations that are tailored to the specific needs and goals of their members. Perpetual Organizations will also have the option of enabling applications for certain roles or having minimum particpatipn token requirements. 

## Treasury Management and Fundraising

Perpetual Organizations can leverage their treasury for growth and sustainability through various methods:
- **NFT Sales**: Generate funds by creating and selling NFTs, tied to either organizational assets or membership privileges.
- **Donations**: Accept contributions directly through decentralized payment systems.
- **Future Fundraising Tools**: Plans to expand fundraising capabilities, providing organizations with more ways to secure financial support.
- **Future Contribution-based Revenue Sharing**: In a future release, a portion of revenue will be paid out to participation token holders for the work they did.
